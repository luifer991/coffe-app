# Coffee Listing web app

This project is a practice project aimed at developing my skills as a developer. I wanted to practice using React, Tailwind CSS, useEffect, and useState to make API requests. By working on this project, I hope to improve my understanding of these technologies and enhance my ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. I am excited to dive into this project and see how my skills grow as a result.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a web development student with the goal of becoming a fullstack developer in the future. Currently, I am focusing my efforts on strengthening my knowledge in front end development, as I believe it is a crucial part in creating web applications. Additionally, I am studying backend development with Java, as I want to have a complete command of both sides of web development. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic and fascinating field.
